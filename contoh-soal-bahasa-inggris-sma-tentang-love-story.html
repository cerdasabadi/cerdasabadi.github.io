                            1. apa tema lagu love story dalam bahasa Inggris​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p> BAHASA INDONESIA:</p><p>“Love Story” menceritakan tentang kisa Romeo dan Juliet. Berbeda dengan kisah aslinya yang cenderung penuh drama dan berakhir tragis karna pasangan tersebut bunuh diri, kisah pada lagu ini seolah-olah berakhir dengan bahagia. Dimana penulis lagu seolah-olah ingin memperbaiki kisah Romeo dan Juliet dengan menuliskan apa yang akan terjadi jika keduanya tidak bunuh diri. Terlihat jelas pada lirik, setelah mereka tidak bunuh diri, mereka menghadapi semua masalah tersebut dan melarikan diri. Meskipun ayahnya menentangnya, mereka terus mempertahankan keyakinan cintanya tersebut sampai akhirnya direstui. Merekapun akhirnya menikah, menjadi raja dan ratu dan hidup bahagia selamanya. Pelajaran yang dapat kita petik dari lagu ini bahwa apa yang menjadi keyakinan kita, asal semua itu benar, maka perjuangkanlah. Karena cinta itu bukan karna paksaan, karna cinta itu adalah hal indah yang seharusnya menjadi kisah yang paling bahagia, bukan malah berakhir tragis.</p><p></p><p>BAHASA INGGRIS:</p><p>"Love Story" tells the story of Romeo and Juliet.  Unlike the original story which tends to be full of drama and tragic ending because the couple committed suicide, the story of this song seems to end happily.  Where songwriters seem to want to improve the story of Romeo and Juliet by writing down what will happen if they don't commit suicide.  Seen clearly in the lyrics, after they did not commit suicide, they faced all these problems and ran away.  Even though his father opposed him, they continued to maintain his love of belief until finally being blessed.  They eventually married, became kings and queens and lived happily ever after.  The lesson we can learn from this song is that what becomes our belief, as long as it is all true, then fight for it.  Because love is not because of coercion, because love is a beautiful thing that should be the happiest story, not even end tragically.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>maaf kalau salah:)</p><p></p><br />

                        I think you can make your love story... Be yourself ya :)Once upon a time, there was once a guy who was very much in love with this girl. This romantic guy folded 1,000 pieces of papercranes as a gift to his girl. Although, at that time he was just a small executive inhis company, his future doesn't seem too bright, they were very happy together. Until one day, his girl told him she was going to Paris and will never come back.She also told him that she cannot visualize any future for the both of them, so let's go their own ways there and then... heartbroken, theguy agreed.When he regained his confidence, he worked hard day and night, just to make something out of himself. Finally with all these hard work and with the help of friends, this guy had set up his own company..."You never fail until you stop trying." he always told himself. "I must make it in life!" One rainy day, while this guy was driving, hesaw an elderly couple sharing an umbrella in the rain walking to some destination. Even with the umbrella, they were still drenched. It didn't take him long to realize those were his ex-girlfriend's parents. With a heart in getting back at them, he drove slowly beside the couple, wanting them to spot him in his luxury saloon. He wanted them to know that he wasn't the same anymore, he had his own company, car, condo, etc. He had made it in life!Before the guy can realize, the couple was walking towards a cemetery, and he got out of his car and followed them...and he saw his exgirlfriend, a photograph of her smilingsweetly as ever at him from her tombstone... and he saw his precious papercranes in a bottle placed beside her tomb. Her parents saw him.He walked over and asked them why this had happened. They explained that she did not leave for France at all. She was stricken ill with cancer. In her heart, she had believed that he will make it someday, but she did not want her illness to be his obstacle ... therefore she had chosen to leave him.She had wanted her parents to put his papercranes beside her, because, if the day comes when fate brings him to her again he can take some of those back with him. The guy just wept.<br />

She lived with her step mother and two step sisters.</p><p>The step mother and sisters were conceited and bad tempered. They treated Cinderella very badly. Her step mother made Cinderella do the hardest works in the house; such as scrubbing the floor, cleaning the pot and pan and preparing the food for the family. The two step sisters, on the other hand, did not work about the house. Their mother gave them many handsome dresses to wear.</p><p>One day, the two step sister received an invitation to the ball that the king’s son was going to give at the palace. They were excited about this and spent so much time choosing the dresses they would wear. At last, the day of the ball came, and away went the sisters to it. Cinderella could not help crying after they had left.</p><p>“Why are crying, Cinderella?” a voice asked. She looked up and saw her fairy godmother standing beside her, “because I want so much to go to the ball” said Cinderella. “Well” said the godmother,”you’ve been such a cheerful, hardworking, uncomplaining girl that I am going to see that you do go to the ball”.</p><p>Magically, the fairy godmother changed a pumpkin into a fine coach and mice into a coachman and two footmen. Her godmother tapped Cinderella’s raged dress with her wand, and it became a beautiful ball gown. Then she gave her a pair of pretty glass slippers. “Now, Cinderella”, she said; “You must leave before midnight”. Then away she drove in her beautiful coach.</p><p>Cinderella was having a wonderfully good time. She danced again and again with the king’s son. Suddenly the clock began to strike twelve, she ran toward the door as quickly as she could. In her hurry, one of her glass slipper was left behind.</p><p>A few days later, the king’ son proclaimed that he would marry the girl whose feet fitted the glass slipper. Her step sisters tried on the slipper but it was too small for them, no matter how hard they squeezed their toes into it. In the end, the king’s page let Cinderella try on the slipper. She stuck out her foot and the page slipped the slipper on. It fitted perfectly.</p><p>Finally, she was driven to the palace. The king’s son was overjoyed to see her again. They were married and live happily ever after.</p><br /><br /><p> </p><p>Generic Structure of Narrative Text int the Story of Cinderella</p><br /><p>example of narrative text about cinderella story performance</p><p>Cinderella story performed on the stage, screened from broadwaycollection.com</p><br /><p>As an example of narrative text about Cinderella, this post tries to give a complete tool to understand the definition and structure of narrative genre. The structure used to organized the paragraphs is called generic Structure and here below.</p><br /><p>1. Orientation: it means to introduce the participants or the characters of the story with the time and place set. Orientation actually exists in every text type though it has different term. In this story, the first paragraph is clearly seen to introduce the participants of the Cinderella Story. They were Cinderella her self as the main character of the story, her step mother which treated Cinderella badly, and her steps sister which supported her mother to make Cinderella was treated very badly. Cinderella was introduced as a hero in this story. She struggled against the bad treatment from her step mother and sisters.</p><p>2. Complication: it is such the crisis of the story. If there is not the crisis, the story is not a narrative text. In a long story, the complication appears in several situations. It means that some time there is more then one complication. In this Cinderella story, we can see clearly that there are Major Complication and Minor Complication.</p><p>The second paragraph is the major complication of this Cinderella story. Cinderella got bad treatment from her stepmother. It is the bad crisis which drives into several minor complications which Cinderella has to overcome.</p><p>3. Resolution: it is the final series of the events which happen in the story. The resolution can be good or bad. The point is that it has been accomplished by the characters. Like complication, there are Major Resolution and Minor Resolution.</p><p>In the last paragraph, it is said that finally Cinderella lived happily. It is the happy resolution of the bad treatment.</p><br />

                        Cerita rakyat from West SumatraOnce upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatra lived a poor woman and his son. The boy was called Malin Kundang. They didn’t earn much as fishing was their only source of income. Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money. However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty. “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother. Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely. “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go. Three days ago, he met one of the successful ship’s crew. Malin was offered to join him. “Take a good care of yourself, son,” said Malin Kundang’s mother as she gave him some food supplies. “Yes, Mother,” Malin Kundang said. “You too have to take a good care of yourself. I’ll keep in touch with you,” he continued before kissing his mother’s hand. Before Malin stepped onto the ship, Malin’s mother hugged him tight as if she didn’t want to let him go.It had been three months since Malin Kundang left his mother. As his mother had predicted before, he hadn’t contacted her yet. Every morning, she stood on the pier. She wished to see the ship that brought Malin kundang home. Every day and night, she prayed to the God for her son’s safety. There was so much prayer that had been said due to her deep love for Malin Kundang. Even though it’s been a year she had not heard any news from Malin Kundang, she kept waiting and praying for him.After several years waiting without any news, Malin Kundang’s mother was suddenly surprised by the arrival of a big ship in the pier where she usually stood to wait for her son. When the ship finally pulled over, Malin Kundang’s mother saw a man who looked wealthy stepping down a ladder along with a beautiful woman. She could not be wrong. Her blurry eyes still easily recognized him. The man was Malin Kundang, her son.Malin Kundang’s mother quickly went to see her beloved son. “Malin, you’re back, son!” said Malin Kundang’s mother and without hesitation, she came running to hug Malin Kundang, “I miss you so much.” But, Malin Kundang didn’t show any respond. He was ashamed to admit his own mother in front of his beautiful wife. “You’re not my Mother. I don’t know you. My mother would never wear such ragged and ugly clothes,” said Malin Kundang as he release his mother embrace.Malin Kundang’s mother take a step back, “Malin…You don’t recognize me? I’m your mother!” she said sadly. Malin Kundang’s face was as cold as ice. “Guard, take this old women out of here,” Malin Kundang ordered his bodyguard. “Give her some money so she won’t disturb me again!” Malin Kundang’s mother cried as she was dragged by the bodyguard, ”Malin… my son. Why do you treat your own mother like this?”Malin Kundang ignored his mother and ordered the ship crews to set sail. Malin Kundang’s mother sat alone in the pier. Her heart was so hurt, she cried and cried. “Dear God, if he isn’t my son, please let him have a save journey. But if he is, I cursed him to become a stone,” she prayed to the God.In the quiet sea, suddenly the wind blew so hard and a thunderstorm came. Malin Kundang’s huge ship was wrecked. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship, and fell on a small island. Suddenly, his whole body turned into stone. He was punished for not admitting his own mother.The Lonely Landy
<br />
One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted
 to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.

<br />

“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too 
sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.

<br />

“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, 
Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to 
you,” said Tito the rooster.

<br />

Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the 
river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”

<br />

Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”

<br />

“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.

<br />

“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. 
Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.

<br />

Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor 
you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and 
helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”

<br />

“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”

<br />

One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his 
friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to 
mess up the party.

<br />

“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” 
said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.

<br />

Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save 
yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku
 pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body 
into a ball.

<br />

Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike 
pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t
 chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.

<br />

“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and 
her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.

<br />Terjemahan

<br />Suatu hari, ada seorang bernama landak Landy. Dia kesepian. Tidak ada 
yang ingin bermain dengannya, karena mereka takut lonjakan nya.

<br />

"Ya Landy. Kami tidak ingin bermain dengan Anda karena Anda terlalu paku
 tajam. Kami tidak ingin Anda menyakiti kita, "kata Cici kelinci satu 
hari.

<br />

"Cici benar, Landy. Ini bukan karena Anda buruk atau kasar kepada kami, 
tidak, Landy. Hanya karena paku Anda. Mereka akan menusuk kita jika kita
 dekat dengan Anda, "kata Tito ayam.

<br />

Landy merasa kesepian. Landy menghabiskan sebagian besar hari waktu 
bermimpi di tepi sungai, "Saya akan senang jika tidak ada paku di tubuh 
saya."

<br />

Tiba-tiba, Kuku kura-kura muncul dari sungai. Dia datang ke Landy dan berkata, "Landy, apa yang Anda pikirkan?"

<br />

"Oh, tidak," jawab Landy.

<br />

"Jangan berbohong padaku, Landy! Siapa tahu aku bisa membantumu, "kata 
Kuku bijak. Kemudian dia duduk di samping Landy. Dia tidak takut 
lonjakan Landy.

<br />

Tak lama, Landy mengatakan masalahnya. Kuku mengangguk kepalanya. Dia 
berkata, "Kasihan kamu. Tapi itu bukan salahmu. Aku tahu, paku Anda 
sangat berguna dan membantu bagi Anda. Mereka akan menyadari suatu hari 
nanti. Percayalah! "

<br />

"Terima kasih, Kuku. Anda adalah teman terbaik saya. "

<br />

Suatu hari, Koko katak mengadakan pesta ulang tahunnya. Dia mengundang 
semua teman-temannya, termasuk Landy. Tapi dia memutuskan untuk tidak 
datang. Dia tidak ingin mengacaukan pesta.

<br />

"Aku akan datang dengan Anda Landy. Aku akan memberitahu semua orang 
bahwa Anda tidak berbahaya, "kata Kuku. Akhirnya Landy menghadiri pesta.
 Semua orang menikmatinya.

<br />

Tiba-tiba Tito berteriak, "Bantuan .... membantu ....! Kejahatan 
serigala datang. Menyelamatkan diri! "Lalu, semua orang menyelamatkan 
hidup mereka, kecuali Kuku dan landy. Kuku menarik kepalanya dan kakinya
 ke dalam cangkangnya. Dan Landy digulung tubuhnya menjadi bola.

<br />

Secara tidak sengaja, serigala jahat menyentuh Landy. Tentu saja, 
lonjakan ditusuk dia. Dia berteriak, "Aduh!" Karena kakinya berdarah, 
dia tidak mengejar teman Landy lagi. Kemudian, dia lari.

<br />

"Horray .... Horray ....! Hidup Landy! Dia menyelamatkan hidup kita, 
"kata Cici dan teman-temannya. Mereka mengucapkan terima kasih dari saat
 itu. Landy tidak kesepian lagi.

                        Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />Do you know “Malin Kundang”? I think among of you knew it well. But not many people know about the legend of “Malin Kundang”.<br /><br />Ladies and gentleman<br />I would like to tell you about “Malin Kundang”. A long time ago, in a small village near the beach in West Sumatra, a woman and her son lived. They were Malin Kundang and her mother. Her mother was a single parent because Malin Kundang's father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang had to live hard with his mother<br /><br />“Mother, what if I sail overseas? if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” said Malin kundang to his mother.<br /><br />His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life. But, promise me, you’ll come home.”<br /><br />In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go.<br /><br />“Ok mom I will go now… Please pray for me mom… See you mom… Bye…Bye…”<br />“Ok Malin… Please take care of yourself. I will always pray for you my son… Good bye…”<br /><br />One day, Malin kundang met a beautiful girl. She was the daughter of his master. They fell in love each other and got married.<br /><br />After several years waiting without any news, Malin Kundang’s mother was suddenly surprised by the arrival of a big ship in the pier.<br /><br />“Waw… What a big &amp; luxury ship…? Whose ship is that?”<br /><br />When the ship finally pulled over, Malin Kundang’s mother saw a man who looked wealthy stepping down a ladder along with a beautiful woman.<br /><br />Her blurry eyes still easily recognized him. The man was Malin Kundang, her son.<br />Do you think Malin Kundang will recognize her mother?<br /><br />Malin Kundang’s mother quickly went to see her beloved son.<br /><br />“Malin, you’re back, son!” said Malin Kundang's mother<br />But, Malin Kundang didn’t show any respond. He was ashamed to recognize his own mother in front of his beautiful wife.<br />“You’re not my Mother. I don’t know you. My mother would never wear such ragged and ugly clothes,” said Malin Kundang.<br /><br />“Malin… Don’t you  recognize me? I’m your mother!” she said sadly.<br /><br />Malin Kundang’s face was as cold as ice and he said.<br />“Guard, take this old woman out of here,and give her some money so she won’t disturb me again!”<br /><br />”Malin… my son. Why do you treat your own mother like this?”<br />"Go! And never once in a while you're annoying me and my wife," he shouted as he drove her mother .<br />“Supercharge you Malin! I am your mother .. but why do not you recognize me?! You are really an ungrateful child ..Oh my God! If he is really my son,Curse him into a stone ...!" she said, cryingly<br /><br />Suddenly, malin kundang’s whole body turned into stone. He was punished for not admitting his own mother.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <strong>The Lonely Landy</strong><br />One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.<br />“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.<br />“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to you,” said Tito the rooster.<br />Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”<br />Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”<br />“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.<br />“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.<br />Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”<br />“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”<br />One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party.<br />“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.<br />Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body into a ball.<br />Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.<br />“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br /><br /><strong>Terjemahan :</strong><br />Suatu hari, ada seorang bernama landak Landy. Dia kesepian. Tidak ada yang ingin bermain dengannya, karena mereka takut lonjakan nya.<br />"Ya Landy. Kami tidak ingin bermain dengan Anda karena Anda terlalu paku tajam. Kami tidak ingin Anda menyakiti kita, "kata Cici kelinci satu hari.<br />"Cici benar, Landy. Ini bukan karena Anda buruk atau kasar kepada kami, tidak, Landy. Hanya karena paku Anda. Mereka akan menusuk kita jika kita dekat dengan Anda, "kata Tito ayam.<br />Landy merasa kesepian. Landy menghabiskan sebagian besar hari waktu bermimpi di tepi sungai, "Saya akan senang jika tidak ada paku di tubuh saya."<br />Tiba-tiba, Kuku kura-kura muncul dari sungai. Dia datang ke Landy dan berkata, "Landy, apa yang Anda pikirkan?"<br />"Oh, tidak," jawab Landy.<br />"Jangan berbohong padaku, Landy! Siapa tahu aku bisa membantumu, "kata Kuku bijak. Kemudian dia duduk di samping Landy. Dia tidak takut lonjakan Landy.<br />Tak lama, Landy mengatakan masalahnya. Kuku mengangguk kepalanya. Dia berkata, "Kasihan kamu. Tapi itu bukan salahmu. Aku tahu, paku Anda sangat berguna dan membantu bagi Anda. Mereka akan menyadari suatu hari nanti. Percayalah! "<br />"Terima kasih, Kuku. Anda adalah teman terbaik saya. "<br />Suatu hari, Koko katak mengadakan pesta ulang tahunnya. Dia mengundang semua teman-temannya, termasuk Landy. Tapi dia memutuskan untuk tidak datang. Dia tidak ingin mengacaukan pesta.<br />"Aku akan datang dengan Anda Landy. Aku akan memberitahu semua orang bahwa Anda tidak berbahaya, "kata Kuku. Akhirnya Landy menghadiri pesta. Semua orang menikmatinya.<br />Tiba-tiba Tito berteriak, "Bantuan .... membantu ....! Kejahatan serigala datang. Menyelamatkan diri! "Lalu, semua orang menyelamatkan hidup mereka, kecuali Kuku dan landy. Kuku menarik kepalanya dan kakinya ke dalam cangkangnya. Dan Landy digulung tubuhnya menjadi bola.<br />Secara tidak sengaja, serigala jahat menyentuh Landy. Tentu saja, lonjakan ditusuk dia. Dia berteriak, "Aduh!" Karena kakinya berdarah, dia tidak mengejar teman Landy lagi. Kemudian, dia lari.<br />"Horray .... Horray ....! Hidup Landy! Dia menyelamatkan hidup kita, "kata Cici dan teman-temannya. Mereka mengucapkan terima kasih dari saat itu. Landy tidak kesepian lagi.<br />

The family consists of father, mother, and a beautiful girl named Garlic. They are a harmonious and happy family despite his father worked as an ordinary merchant. One day, the happiness in this family was lost because the mother died. Garlic was very sad because she was very fond of her mother. Her father was also so sad because he loved his wife so much.<br /><br />After Garlic’s mother died, her house was visited frequently by a widow who had a daughter named Onion. The widow often came with Onion to the Garlic’s home by bringing food, helping to clean the house, and chatting with Garlic’s father. Finally, the father thinks that he should marry the widow and made the widow as a new mother for Garlic.<br /><br />He asked for consideration of the proposal to Garlic. After being allowed to get married by Garlic, then her father immediately carried out the marriage. They become a new family and lived in a house. At first, the mother and Onions behaved Garlic very well. However, the good behavior did not to be last long. Soon, the Onion and her mother began to show their bad attitude. Garlic was often scolded and given heavy works when the father went to trade. She had to do a lot of housework while the Onions just sit and did not work at all. However, the situation was never told by her to his father, so the Garlic continued to be treated badly by Onions and her mother.<br /><br />One day, his father was sick and passed away. Since then, Garlic was treated worse than before. Garlic almost never had a break every day. In the morning, she had to get up in order to prepare breakfast and the water for Onion and her mother. Later, she also gave eating to the livestock, washing clothes, and even watering the entire garden. Although she should do so many works, she always did it happily. She hoped, with such sincerity, her mother would love her sincerely someday.<br /><br />On the morning, Garlic went to the river to wash the clothes. She was so excited and washed vigorously. Because of getting too excited, she was not aware that there was a shirt that washed away. She realized that the shirt had been washed away when the flow carried it far enough. Later, she pursued but did not get the shirt. She felt hopeless and immediately went home.<br /><br />The shirt was her mother’s favorite. Of course, the mother was angry and told her to look for the shirt until she could found it. Garlic came back to the river and walked to the west to seek her mother’s favorite shirt. She walked along the river up to tens of kilometers. After that, Garlic suddenly saw someone who was bathing the buffalo in the river. She asked the man about the clothes were washed away. Later, she was informed that the shirt drifting and it was not far from where she was standing. At that moment, Garlic immediately ran down the river to find the shirt.<br /><br />It was getting dark and the Garlic found a home. Because of completely exhausted, she decided to take a break in the house. Apparently, it housed an old lady who had previously found the shirt. The old lady wanted to return the shirt to her, but she should accompany the old lady during a week. She agreed to stay with the lady for a week. Within a week, she made the old lady to be so happy because she was diligent and never complained even though felt so tired.<br /><br />After accompanying for a week, she was given a pumpkin as the gift. When opening it, she was very surprised because there were so much gold and gems. She immediately went home and told the happening to her mother and also Onion. However, the gold and jewels that she got immediately seized and she was forced to tell where the jewelry could be obtained. Garlic immediately said that she got it from an old lady who lived near the river.<br /><br />In the next day, Onion came to that house and stayed for a week like what Garlic did. However, because Onion was a lazy girl, the old lady gave a different pumpkin from Garlic. Onion did not care and Onion immediately went home to open the pumpkin with her mother. Apparently, the content was not gems or gold, but the venomous snake that bit of Onion and the mother. Both of them died because of their greed.<br /><br />After the happening, Garlic was living alone, but she was more calm and lived happily with its gold and gem<br /><br />

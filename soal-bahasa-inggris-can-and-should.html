It is an important issue because it ...(54)...fundamental moral and economic questions about the way we use our native wildlife.
It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.
Dr Alison Lane, the director of the Cairns Marine Science Institute, contends...(57)...we need marine parks for scientific research. She argues that much of our knowledge of marine mammals comes from studies which were undertaken at marine parks. The knowledge which is obtained at marine parks, so this argument  goes, can be useful for planning for...(58).... However, as Jones (1991) explains, park research is only useful for understanding captive animals and is not useful for learning about animals in the wild. Dolphin and whale biology changes in marine park conditions. Their diets are different, they have significantly lower life spans and they are ...(59).... In addition, marine mammals in dolphin parks are trained and this means that patterns of social behaviour are changed. Therefore, research ...(60)...at marine parks is generally not reliable.

                                            tolong bantu jawab bahasa InggrisCristiano RonaldoCristiano Ronaldo has very strong determination. He used to train very hard since his childhood. He knew that a footballer requires good stamina because a football match requires a player to run at least 10 kilometers in a single match. Sometimes, he even trained himself continuously from morning until evening. He also challenged himself by playing along with older players.He becomes so skillful and confident that his opponents cannot figure out how to stop Ronaldo from making a goal. Normal football players will use their single leg of their dominant side body, i.e. players of right-handed or left-handed use their respective legs to score goals but Ronaldo can easily use both of his legs efficiently to make goals. In addition to that, he can use his head to score goals as well.He is also one of the fastest football players in football history. Ronaldo can run very fast, he can run with a speed of 33.6 kilometers per hour. That is why he is also known as a rocket man. This helps Ronaldo to do his famous free-kick. Ronaldo's free-kick speed is approximately 130 kilometers per hour.While jumping, Ronaldo's G-force is five times higher than that of a cheetah.

What is the indirect object of the underlined sentence (2) 3. The Right to Die A difficult problem that is facing society is euthanasia, another word for mercy killing. Thousands of young people are mortally ill because of incurable disease. They are all kept alive in artificial ways. They have no chance to recover completely, but most of the legal systems do not allow doctors to end their lives. However, fatally ill patients should be allowed to die for several reasons. The first reason is that medical costs are very high. The cost of a hospital room can be as much as a hundred dollars per day and even more. The costs of medicines and medical tests are also high. The family of the patient is responsible for these expenses. Consequently, they would be a terribleinancialburden for themor a long time.In conclusion, because terminallyill patientshave no chance to live normal lives, they shouldbe allowed to die with dignity. Therefore, thefamily shouldhave the right to ask to turn off the life-support machines or to stop further medical treatment. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a. Who are keptlive in artificialays? b. What are the rasonshypatients are allowed to die? c. How much isrobably the cost of a hospital room for 3 (three) days? d. Who shouldmostly take care of the terminally illatient? e. Why does the text mention Karen Quinlan in Paragraph 3? f. What isthe function of life-support machine? g. Why was Karen’s breathing machine turned off? 4. Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which ishe predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil," which istill used in radio technology.  Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856. Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.  After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague duringthe 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange. Itwas while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.  Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for a number of important inventions — most of which wer officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field — the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a.

It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast.

                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.

read the and answer the questions.
 why students should stop cheating 
 People say that corruption begins with small practices of dishonesty in daily life. this is very apparent is school. the pressure to pass tests has led many students to cheat during tests. this practice should be discouraged, as cheating has no benefit for students.
 Firs, by cheating, students fail to use their own intelligence. they might underestimate their actual abilities due to anxiety and fear of failure, cheating keeps students from understanding their abilities and potentials. they might actually be able to pass the test if they study hard.
 Second, cheating on other students leads to dependency. students who don't prepare for a test well and cheat other students will get even more anxiox when others can't help them.
 Third, when students cheat, they are actually fooling and lying to themselves. if this continuest, the will be led into the habit of doing anything to get what they want, even if it means doing morally questionable acts. This habit is what starts corrupt practices. cheating during tests is a "small" form of corruption, but as time passes, it can lead to bigger forms.
 Based on those reasons, we can conclude that cheating is a bad habit that should be discourage in students.

It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.
Dr Alison Lane, the director of the Cairns Marine Science Institute, contends...(57)...we need marine parks for scientific research.

Flood
Flooding is a natural phenomenon that usually happens in a lot of areas drained by the river flow. In simple terms, it can be defined as the presence of flood water in a vast region that covers the area of the earth’s surface.
Flooding process itself occurs when the rains come and cause water sources such as rivers, seas, lakes, and ditches no longer able to accommodate the water drop. The barren land covered with trees without overflowing water will speed up the process of proficiency level, because the trees that should absorb the water have been used as a furniture material. When the water source is no longer able to accommodate, the water will overflow and flow into residential areas and have a big impact. Nowadays, flood is an annually happening in some big cities in Indonesia, especially Jakarta.
So, that’s the explanation of flood and how does it happen.</a>

In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.

It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.

                            7. tolong bantu jawab bahasa InggrisCristiano RonaldoCristiano Ronaldo has very strong determination. He used to train very hard since his childhood. He knew that a footballer requires good stamina because a football match requires a player to run at least 10 kilometers in a single match. Sometimes, he even trained himself continuously from morning until evening. He also challenged himself by playing along with older players.He becomes so skillful and confident that his opponents cannot figure out how to stop Ronaldo from making a goal. Normal football players will use their single leg of their dominant side body, i.e. players of right-handed or left-handed use their respective legs to score goals but Ronaldo can easily use both of his legs efficiently to make goals. In addition to that, he can use his head to score goals as well.He is also one of the fastest football players in football history. Ronaldo can run very fast, he can run with a speed of 33.6 kilometers per hour. That is why he is also known as a rocket man. This helps Ronaldo to do his famous free-kick. Ronaldo's free-kick speed is approximately 130 kilometers per hour.While jumping, Ronaldo's G-force is five times higher than that of a cheetah. He can jump up to 78 cm in the air; this jumping height is much more compared to any basketball player. All of these have helped him achieve his success. In his young age, he has won many trophies and broken records including winning the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or award five times and created a world record by scoring the most goals in international football in September 2021. Currently his net worth is around $500 million and this makes him one of the richest athletes.SoalQ:What do you think are two most important traits that should be owned by great athletes?A:Q: What are two physical descriptions that you use to describe Cristiano Ronaldo?A:Q: Mention two facts about Cristiano Ronaldo that you believe make him a great athlete.A:Q: What are three descriptive words that you use the most when drawing a person?A:Q: How did you start your descriptive paragraph?

The Right to Die A difficult problem that is facing society is euthanasia, another word for mercy killing. Thousands of young people are mortally ill because of incurable disease. They are all kept alive in artificial ways. They have no chance to recover completely, but most of the legal systems do not allow doctors to end their lives. However, fatally ill patients should be allowed to die for several reasons. The first reason is that medical costs are very high. The cost of a hospital room can be as much as a hundred dollars per day and even more. The costs of medicines and medical tests are also high. The family of the patient is responsible for these expenses. Consequently, they would be a terribleinancialburden for themor a long time.In conclusion, because terminallyill patientshave no chance to live normal lives, they shouldbe allowed to die with dignity. Therefore, thefamily shouldhave the right to ask to turn off the life-support machines or to stop further medical treatment. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a. Who are keptlive in artificialays? b. What are the rasonshypatients are allowed to die? c. How much isrobably the cost of a hospital room for 3 (three) days? d. Who shouldmostly take care of the terminally illatient? e. Why does the text mention Karen Quinlan in Paragraph 3? f. What isthe function of life-support machine? g. Why was Karen’s breathing machine turned off? 4. Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which ishe predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla coil," which istill used in radio technology.  Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856. Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.  After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague duringthe 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone Exchange. Itwas while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.  Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for a number of important inventions — most of which wer officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field — the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil. Please answer the following questions based on the text above! a.

                            18. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.

read the and answer the questions.
 why students should stop cheating 
 People say that corruption begins with small practices of dishonesty in daily life. this is very apparent is school. the pressure to pass tests has led many students to cheat during tests. this practice should be discouraged, as cheating has no benefit for students.
 Firs, by cheating, students fail to use their own intelligence. they might underestimate their actual abilities due to anxiety and fear of failure, cheating keeps students from understanding their abilities and potentials. they might actually be able to pass the test if they study hard.
 Second, cheating on other students leads to dependency. students who don't prepare for a test well and cheat other students will get even more anxiox when others can't help them.
 Third, when students cheat, they are actually fooling and lying to themselves. if this continuest, the will be led into the habit of doing anything to get what they want, even if it means doing morally questionable acts. This habit is what starts corrupt practices. cheating during tests is a "small" form of corruption, but as time passes, it can lead to bigger forms.
 Based on those reasons, we can conclude that cheating is a bad habit that should be discourage in students.

It is an important issue because it ...(54)...fundamental moral and economic questions about the way we use our native wildlife.
It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.
Dr Alison Lane, the director of the Cairns Marine Science Institute, contends...(57)...we need marine parks for scientific research. She argues that much of our knowledge of marine mammals comes from studies which were undertaken at marine parks. The knowledge which is obtained at marine parks, so this argument  goes, can be useful for planning for...(58).... However, as Jones (1991) explains, park research is only useful for understanding captive animals and is not useful for learning about animals in the wild. Dolphin and whale biology changes in marine park conditions. Their diets are different, they have significantly lower life spans and they are ...(59).... In addition, marine mammals in dolphin parks are trained and this means that patterns of social behaviour are changed. Therefore, research ...(60)...at marine parks is generally not reliable.

It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.
Dr Alison Lane, the director of the Cairns Marine Science Institute, contends...(57)...we need marine parks for scientific research. She argues that much of our knowledge of marine mammals comes from studies which were undertaken at marine parks. The knowledge which is obtained at marine parks, so this argument  goes, can be useful for planning for...(58).... However, as Jones (1991) explains, park research is only useful for understanding captive animals and is not useful for learning about animals in the wild. Dolphin and whale biology changes in marine park conditions. Their diets are different, they have significantly lower life spans and they are ...(59).... In addition, marine mammals in dolphin parks are trained and this means that patterns of social behaviour are changed. Therefore, research ...(60)...at marine parks is generally not reliable.
